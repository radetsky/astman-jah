This is the astman.js originally written by Mark Spenser from Digium.
I patched original file to use jQuery not Prototype. 
I'm using jQuery and jQueryUI as Javascript frameworks to build web GUI applications.
Prototype and jQuery is different and not compatible. 

Take a look of ajamdemo.html, that shows how I use patched astman.
You may want to change a username and secret in line #93 (doLogin) to see which events generates your asterisk. 

PS. I called it astman-jah just for fun. Please keep smiling. :-)
